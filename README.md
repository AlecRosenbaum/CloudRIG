# CloudRig

Set this up first [Gaming on Amazon's EC2](https://medium.com/@bmatcuk/gaming-on-amazon-s-ec2-83b178f47a34#.3oefd1r82).

Send me a message if you'd like to use my preconfigured AMI.

You will then need to set up ZeroTier.

Set up an RDP connection called "cloudrig" and login.

**Only tested on Mac so far.**

## Set up

You can have a special IAM user for this if you want. Follow the [Credentials Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-multiple-profiles).

* Make sure things are tagged correctly (cloudrig)

## Using

Either use Electron app or CLI
